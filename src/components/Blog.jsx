          The three main components of a plant are roots, stem and leaves. Roots absorb water and
          minerals from the soil and keep it firmly placed in the ground. The stem acts as a carrier
          and transports the water and minerals to the leaves. It also provides over ground support
          to the plant. Leaves convert sunlight and use the energy to make food through the process
          of photosynthesis. Plants trap energy from sunlight, use water and carbon dioxide from the
          air to create glucose. They use glucose to grow and stay alive.
